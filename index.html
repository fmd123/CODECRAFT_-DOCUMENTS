<h2>Worth Reading</h2>

<p>Sheila Heti's <em>How Should A Person Be?</em></p>
<p>Hogg's <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Memoirs_and_Confessions_of_a_Justified_Sinner" target="_blank"> <em>The Private Memoirs and Confessions of A Justified Sinner</em></a></p>
<!-- I was able to have this open in a new tab/window by using target="_blank"  but there were warnings about "tabnabbing" What is that?-->
<p>Early horror novel that is better and funnier than Frankenstein It has a much more interesting plot. Clever use of unreliable narrator</p>

<!--  Can I embed a video? Yes! right clicked to get menu and copied embed code. I had to remove one attribute that was no longer supported in HTML5 that the validator objected to.-->
